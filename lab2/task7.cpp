s/*Task 7) You are tasked with building a simple product management system for an online store.
1. Create a function that allows the addition of a new product to the system. The function should
    take parameters such as product name, price, quantity, and any other relevant details.
2. Implement a function that takes a product ID as input and displays detailed information about the
    product, including its name, price, quantity in stock, and any other relevant details.
3. Design a function that enables the update of product information. It should take a product ID as
    well as the new details (e.g., updated price, quantity, etc.) and modify the existing productâ€™s information accordingly.
4. Create a function that removes a product from the system based on its product ID. Ensure that
    the inventory is updated after the removal.
