/*TASK # 05
You are building an employee management system. Create a class `Employee` to manage employee
records.
Requirements:
    1. Attributes:
     `employeeID` (int)
     `name` (string)
     `department` (string)
     `salary` (double)
2. Define a default constructor that initializes `salary` to `0.0`.
3. Define a parameterized constructor to initialize all attributes.
4. Add methods:
     `giveBonus(double amount)`: Adds the bonus amount to the employee's salary.
     `isManager()`: Returns `true` if the employee's department is "Management".
     `displayDetails()`: Displays the employee's details.
5. Create a few `Employee` objects and test the methods.*/
